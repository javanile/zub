# Oris

*A high-performance heap allocator, after the folk-allotters of fate.*

A Rust and Zig port of Dimitar Lazarov's **HPHA** (2007).

**Working draft — v0.4. Design stage — stubs, coding conventions, and CI scaffolding are in place; the allocator core lands in v0.1.0.**

## Status

Oris is at its design-and-scaffolding stage — the design documents are settled and per-port build/CI scaffolding is in place, ahead of the v0.1.0 allocator implementation. The two foundational documents are:

- **[BRIEF.md](BRIEF.md)** — design rationale, etymological grounding, target workloads, prior-art positioning
- **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** — milestones, versioning policy, the cross-language invariant

## Structure

- **[Cpp/](Cpp/)** — the canonical HPHA reference source from 2007, included for diff and reference purposes. See [Cpp/NOTICE.md](Cpp/NOTICE.md) for the license trail.
- **[Rust/](Rust/)** — the `orisnik` crate (targets Rust 1.85 / edition 2024). Name reserved on crates.io at `0.0.0`; allocator core forthcoming in v0.1.0.
- **[Zig/](Zig/)** — the `orisnitsa` module (targets Zig 0.16.0). Stub package and manifest in place; allocator core forthcoming in v0.1.0.
- **[.github/workflows/](.github/workflows/)** — CI for both ports (3-OS matrix; Rust adds a Miri soundness lane) plus tag-driven publishing: crates.io via Trusted Publishing, and a re-rooted Zig release asset.

## Coding conventions

Both ports follow the [Amphigraphic](https://github.com/PCfVW/Amphigraphic-Strict) `Grit`
discipline, extended for a high-performance heap allocator (`Grit-ORIS`):

- **[Rust/CONVENTIONS.md](Rust/CONVENTIONS.md)** — `orisnik`
- **[Zig/CONVENTIONS.md](Zig/CONVENTIONS.md)** — `orisnitsa`

The two share the cross-port-invariant discipline (see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)): an identical
public alloc/free sequence must produce identical internal state transitions across both ports.
The `CLAUDE.md` files (repo root and one per port) wire these conventions into AI-assisted edits.
