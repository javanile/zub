# Zig client for Beanstalkd
[![CI](https://github.com/g41797/beanstalkz/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/g41797/beanstalkz/actions/workflows/ci.yml)


**Beanstalkd** is
>             Simple and fast general purpose work queue.
>         The beauty of Beanstalkd is its absolute simplicity.


Actually you can use just 3 commands

- submit(**put**) job into the queue
- take(**reserve**) job from the queue for processing
- **delete** job from the queue

```zig
    // On producer side
    _ = try producer.put(1, 0, 120, "job data");
    
    // On worker side
    var job: Job = .{};
    try job.init(allocator);
    defer job.deinit();
    
    try worker.reserve(10, &job);
        
    // job.body().? - contains "job data"
    // process job
    // ...........
    
    // job.id().?   - contains job id
    try worker.delete(job.id().?);
```
Beanstalkd is the part of main distros - [see instructions](https://beanstalkd.github.io/download.html).

And of course you can use Beanstalkd [with Docker](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=beanstalkd).  

If you don't have experience using `Beanstalkd`, it's a good idea to read:

- [beanstalkd FAQ](https://pmatseykanets.github.io/beanstalkd-docs/resources/faq.html)
- [Giant Killing with Beanstalkd](https://www.sitepoint.com/giant-killing-with-beanstalkd/)
- [beanstalkd protocol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beanstalkd/beanstalkd/master/doc/protocol.txt)

or visit [Beanstalkd repository](https://github.com/beanstalkd/beanstalkd)

## Job

*Job* is opaque array of bytes. Beanstalkd does not force you to use a specific data format.

After being placed in a queue, job can be in the following states:

- delayed (waiting for time-out before moving to next state) 
- ready (for processing)
- reserved (processed)
- buried (failed)


## Job lifecycle supported by beanstalkz
```txt
  'put' with delay                                'delete'             
  ----------------> [DELAYED] ---------------------------X
                        |     
                        | 'kick-job' or time passes
                        |              
  'put'                 v     'reserve'           'delete'
  -----------------> [READY] ---------> [RESERVED] ------X
                       |  ^                 |  
                       |  |                 | 'bury'
                       |  |   'kick-job'    v     'delete'
                       |   `------------ [BURIED]  ------X    
                       |                  
                       |                          'delete'
                        `--------------------------------X
```


## Tube

Instead of the term _queue_ Beanstalkd uses term _tube_,
this explains the picture above.

*Tube* is _named queue_. 
>Tubes are created on demand whenever they are referenced.
> 
> If a tube is empty (that is, it contains no ready, delayed, or buried jobs)
> 
> and no client refers to it, it will be deleted.

If tube was not referenced, Beanstalkd creates *"default"* tube.

Every tube has 3 sub-queues:

- delay - contains jobs in _delayed_ state
- ready - contains jobs in _ready_ or _reserved_ states
- bury (dead-letter) - contains failed jobs
