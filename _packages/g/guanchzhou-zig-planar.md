# zig-planar

Planarity testing, embeddings, colourings and shortest paths of planar
graphs, in pure Zig 0.17.

![A map of 28 regions becomes a planar graph, zig-planar colours it with four colours, and the map needs all four](docs/four-colours.gif)

- **Planarity test with embedding**: the left-right algorithm in linear time.
  A planar graph comes back with a combinatorial embedding: the neighbours of
  every vertex in cyclic order.
- **Certificates both ways**: an embedding can be checked by tracing its
  faces and computing its genus. A non-planar graph gets a subdivided K5 or
  K3,3, which is checked by a separate routine that runs no planarity test.
- **Colourings**: smallest-last greedy (at most 6 colours on a planar graph),
  a guaranteed 5-colouring by Kempe chains, and a 4-colouring.
- **Shortest paths from every vertex of a face**: Klein's multiple-source
  shortest paths. One run gives a shortest-path tree rooted at each boundary
  vertex in O(n log n) time, stored as one tree plus the parent changes
  between consecutive roots.
- No dependencies and no C. Checked against networkx. MIT licensed.

The 4-colouring is not the near-linear algorithm of Inoue, Kawarabayashi,
Miyashita, Mohar, Thomassen and Thorup (2026). That algorithm depends on a
large set of D-reducible configurations and their reductions. `four` uses
Kempe-chain search instead. Every colouring it returns is proper, but there
is no proven time bound, so it can stop with `error.SearchLimit`.

## Library

| Module | What it does | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `graph` | Simple undirected graphs in CSR form, with half-edges and twins | |
| `planarity` | `embed` and `isPlanar`: the left-right planarity test | de Fraysseix and Rosenstiehl 1985; Brandes 2009 |
| `embedding` | Rotation systems: faces, face count and genus | Euler's formula |
| `kuratowski` | `find` a K5 or K3,3 subdivision; `classify` one without a planarity test | Kuratowski 1930 |
| `color` | `greedy`, `five`, `four`, smallest-last order, `isProper` | Matula and Beck 1983; Heawood 1890; Brélaz 1979 |
| `mssp` | `trees` from every vertex of a face, `Walk` over them, `distances` | Klein 2005 and 2026; Sleator and Tarjan 1983 |

```zig
const g = try planar.Graph.init(gpa, n, edges);
defer g.deinit(gpa);
if (try planar.planarity.embed(gpa, g)) |e| {
    defer e.deinit(gpa);
    std.debug.assert(try e.genus(gpa) == 0);
    const colors = try planar.color.four(gpa, g, .{});
    defer gpa.free(colors);

    // lengths[h] is the length of half-edge h, from g.from[h] to g.adj[h].
    const t = try planar.mssp.trees(gpa, g, e, lengths, .{ u, v });
    defer t.deinit(gpa);
    var walk = try planar.mssp.Walk.init(gpa, &t);
    defer walk.deinit(gpa);
    while (true) {
        // walk.parent is the shortest-path tree rooted at walk.root().
        try planar.mssp.distances(gpa, g, lengths, walk.parent, dist);
        if (!walk.next()) break;
    }
}
```

Conventions:

- Self loops and repeated edges are dropped when a graph is built.
- `embed` returns null for a non-planar graph. All three passes of the
  left-right test are iterative, so a path with 200,000 vertices does not
  overflow the stack.
- Faces are traced by following a dart u -> v with the dart from v to the
  neighbour after u in v's rotation. An embedding has genus 0 exactly when
  V - E + F = 2 on every connected component.
- `kuratowski.find` deletes each edge in turn and keeps it deleted while the
  rest stays non-planar. It runs one planarity test per edge, so it takes
  O(m^2) time.
- `five` and `four` return `error.NotPlanar` for a non-planar graph.
- `four` colours in smallest-last order. When all four colours already
  appear around a vertex, it searches up to three Kempe-chain swaps that free
  one. Chains are first tried with a size limit, because a small chain that
  frees a colour works as well as a large one, and two-colour chains in a
  large triangulation can span most of the graph. If a pass gets stuck, it
  tries again with shuffled orders, and finally runs an exact DSATUR search
  with a step limit. `FourOptions.stats` reports which of these succeeded.
- `mssp.trees` takes a planar embedding of a connected graph, a nonnegative
  length for each half-edge (the two directions may differ) and a dart
  u -> v. The boundary is the face traced from that dart, in the same order
  as `Embedding.faces`; a face that passes a vertex twice lists it twice.
  The result is the tree rooted at the first boundary vertex and, for each
  later one, the vertices that get a new parent. Klein shows that every dart
  enters the tree at most once around the face, so there are O(n) changes in
  all; the golden tests check that at most one change per dart happens.
- `mssp.trees` puts a vertex inside the face with a spoke to each corner and
  moves the source by lengthening one spoke while shortening the next. The
  non-tree edges form a spanning tree of the dual graph. It is kept in a
  link-cut tree, so each change of parent costs O(log n). Lengths may add up
  to at most 2^58, so that every intermediate value fits in 64 bits.

[`examples/map.zig`](examples/map.zig) 4-colours the land borders of mainland
South America, where Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay all border each
other, and finds a K3,3 subdivision in the Petersen graph.

## Command line

`zig build` installs `zig-out/bin/zig-planar`. Each command reads one JSON
object on stdin and writes one JSON object on stdout. Edges are `[u, v]`
pairs.

```sh
$ echo '{"n":4,"edges":[[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]}' | zig-planar planar
{"planar":true,"rotation":[[1,3,2],[0,2,3],[1,0,3],[2,0,1]],"faces":[[0,1,2],[0,3,1],[0,2,3],[1,3,2]]}
$ echo '{"n":6,"edges":[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]],"certificate":true}' | zig-planar planar
{"planar":false,"kuratowski":{"kind":"K3,3","edges":[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]}}
$ echo '{"n":6,"edges":[[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[5,1],[5,2],[5,3],[5,4],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1]]}' | zig-planar color
{"colors":[2,0,1,0,1,2],"used":3,"passes":1,"exact_steps":0}
```

`paths` takes a `"boundary"` dart and edges that may carry a length, `[u, v,
length]`, which defaults to 1. It prints the boundary, the tree rooted at the
first boundary vertex as parent vertices, and one list of `[vertex, new
parent]` per move to the next boundary vertex, with `null` for the new root.
`"distances":true` adds one row of distances per boundary vertex.

```sh
$ echo '{"n":4,"edges":[[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[3,0,1],[0,2,5]],"boundary":[0,1],"distances":true}' | zig-planar paths
{"boundary":[0,1,2],"parent":[null,0,1,0],"steps":[[[1,null],[0,1]],[[2,null],[3,2],[0,3],[1,2]]],"distances":[[0,1,2,1],[1,0,1,2],[2,1,0,1]]}
```

![The root of a shortest-path tree walks around the outer face of a 106-vertex triangulation; at each step the vertices that take a new parent turn red, 570 changes in all](docs/shortest-paths.gif)

`color` takes `"method"`: `"four"` (the default), `"five"` or `"greedy"`.
`zig-planar --help` lists every command. Invalid input exits with 1; an
unknown or missing command exits with 2.

## Performance

Random Delaunay triangulations, ReleaseFast, Apple M5. Times are for the whole
command, including reading and writing JSON.

| Vertices | Edges | networkx 3.7 `check_planarity` | `zig-planar planar` | `zig-planar color` (four) |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 100,000 | 299,972 | 5.18 s | 0.37 s | 0.16 s |
| 1,000,000 | 2,999,965 | 62.9 s | 2.32 s | 2.57 s |

Both 4-colourings came from the first Kempe pass, with no exact search.

For `paths`, the triangulations have a ring of points on the outer face, and
each edge a random length from 1 to 999. The networkx column runs Dijkstra
from a few boundary vertices and multiplies by the number of boundary
vertices; those roots were also used to check the `paths` trees.

| Vertices | Outer face | Parent changes | `zig-planar paths` | networkx Dijkstra from every outer vertex |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 100,000 | 2,000 | 228,466 | 0.81 s | 438 s (0.219 s per root) |
| 1,000,000 | 6,000 | 2,202,484 | 10.5 s | 4.2 h (2.53 s per root) |

`paths` prints the trees in their compact form. Distances for any one root
then take O(n) time to compute from its tree.

```

`test/reference.py` builds 435 graphs: named graphs (K5, K3,3, Petersen,
hypercubes, platonic solids, subdivisions), Delaunay triangulations with
edges removed or added, random graphs and random trees with extra edges. It
records networkx's planarity answer for each, along with three large
triangulations of up to 5,000 vertices. `test/golden.zig` requires:

- the same answer as networkx on every graph;
- for planar graphs, a genus-0 embedding with the right neighbours, and
  proper 6-, 5- and 4-colourings;
- for non-planar graphs with at most 200 edges, a Kuratowski subgraph that
  `classify` accepts;
- for connected planar graphs, from the largest face and one random face,
  with lengths from 1 to 1000 and again from 0 to 3: every tree of
  `mssp.trees` gives the distances of a separate Dijkstra from its root,
  and no more parent changes than darts. Disconnected graphs must return
  `error.Disconnected`.

The fuzz targets check properties on random small graphs:

- every planarity answer comes with a certificate that checks: a genus-0
  embedding or a K5 or K3,3 subdivision;
- planar graphs get proper 5- and 4-colourings;
- smallest-last order is a permutation in which no vertex has more than
  degeneracy later neighbours, and greedy colouring stays within
  degeneracy + 1 colours;
- with a different random length in each direction, including 0, every
  multiple-source tree gives the Bellman-Ford distances from its root.

The link-cut tree is checked against a naive forest on 4,000 random links,
cuts, path minima and shifts.
