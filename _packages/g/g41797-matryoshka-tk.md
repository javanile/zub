## The problem

Zig Io gives you excellent tools:

- Tasks.
- Groups.
- Futures.
- Synchronization.
- Cancellation.
- Concurrency.
- Async...
- And much more.

There are many ways to combine them.

Matryoshka-Tk takes a different approach.

It _removes choices_:

- a small subset of **Threaded** Io functionality
- restricted cancellation points
- a few building blocks
- a few rules
- clear communication
- manageable resource reuse

The hard problems do not disappear.

But they become easier to discuss.

Because the system becomes **_visible_**.

---

## Four building blocks. One principle. Common language.

Every Matryoshka-Tk system is built from _four building blocks_:

- **Master** — execution
- **Item** — state/data/command/...
- **Mailbox** — communication
- **Pool** — resource reuse

They all follow one _principle_:

> **Share by communicating.**

You stop talking about:

- tasks
- futures
- mutexes
- queues

You start talking on Matryoshka-Tk language:

- Masters
- Items
- Mailboxes
- Pools


---


### Master

A **Master** is

- 100% YOUR CODE
- an _Threaded_ Io _task_
- created by _concurrent()_
- usually long running
- process oriented
- works with **Items**
- communicate via **Mailboxes** with another Masters and/or application
- reuses Items via **Pools**


---


### Item

An **Item** is

- YOUR DATA/CODE with embedded Matryoshka struct 
- movable application object
    - PDL Page
    - Image
    - PrintTicket
    - ...
- **allocated** (as all building blocks)
- usually outlive the function that created them

---

### Item and ItemHandle.

The documentation talks about _Item(s)_.      
The API works with an **ItemHandle**.  

You are thinking in terms of:

- read _file_
- write _file_
- close _file_

on API level one of the arguments is _file handle_.

The same is for Matryoshka-Tk API

- you are thinking in terms of _Item_ - Application entity
- API is working with _ItemHandle_ - Matryoshka-Tk entity


---


### Mailbox

A **Mailbox** transfers an Item from one Master to another:

- One Master sends an Item to
  - Mailbox ensures that it's only owner of Item
- Another Master later receives it
  - Mailbox ensures that receiver is only owner of Item

---


### Pool

A **Pool**

- creates new Items
- holds reusable Items

Usually Master

- gets Item from Pool
- process Item
- on finish
  - send Item to another Master for further processing
  - returns Item to Pool

A Pool is not storage.  
An empty Pool is

- not an error
- it is backpressure.

Matryoshka-Tk supports backpressure 'naturally'

---

## Take it easy

Start with Items.

Add a Pool when reuse becomes useful.

Add a Mailbox when communication becomes useful.

Organize long-running tasks as Masters.

Can you describe your application using only

- Masters
- Items
- Mailboxes
- Pools

If
- **yes** - you are on the right way
- no - [you still have the chance](https://github.com/g41797/matryoshka-tk)
