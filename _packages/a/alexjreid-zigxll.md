# zigxll

A Zig framework for building Excel XLL add-ins including streaming data and Lua scripting support.

[Template repo](https://github.com/AlexJReid/zigxll-standalone/) | [Example project](./example) | [NATS pub/sub connector](https://github.com/AlexJReid/zigxll-connectors-nats/)

## Documentation

- [Creating functions](./docs/functions.md) - types, options, returning strings/arrays, namespacing
- [RTD servers](./docs/rtd-servers.md) - pushing live data to Excel, using RTD from UDFs
- [Lua functions](./docs/lua-functions.md) - writing Excel functions in Lua
- [How it works](./docs/how-it-works.md) - comptime code generation, architecture

## Why XLLs

XLL add-ins are native DLLs that run inside the Excel process with no serialization or IPC overhead. Excel calls your functions directly and can parallelize them across cores during recalculation.

The catch: the C SDK dates from the early 1990s. Memory management is manual, the type system is painful, and there's almost no tooling. Microsoft themselves call it "impractical for most users."

## Why Zig

Zig's C interop and comptime make the SDK usable. You write normal Zig functions with standard types. The framework generates all the Excel boilerplate at compile time: exports, type conversions, registration, COM vtables for RTD.

What Zig gives us:

- No boilerplate - define functions with `ExcelFunction()` and macros with `ExcelMacro()`, framework handles the rest
- Type-safe conversions between Zig types and XLOPER12
- UTF-8 strings (framework handles UTF-16 conversion)
- Zig errors become `#VALUE!` in Excel. For specific errors (`#N/A`, `#DIV/0!`, etc.), return `XLValue.na()`, `XLValue.errDiv0()`, etc.
- Thread-safe by default (MTR)
- Zero function call overhead — [2000 Black-Scholes calculations recalc in under 7ms](./example#example-functions) on a basic PC
- Cross-compilation from Mac/Linux via [xwin](https://jake-shadle.github.io/xwin/)
- Async functions - add `.is_async = true` to run on a thread pool with automatic caching. See [function docs](./docs/functions.md#async-functions)
- Pure Zig COM RTD servers - no ATL/MFC. See [RTD docs](./docs/rtd-servers.md)
- Embed Lua scripts as Excel functions with automatic type marshaling, including async and thread-safe support. See [Lua docs](./docs/lua-functions.md)

## Quick start

> See [example](./example) for a complete working project.

Add ZigXLL as a dependency in your `build.zig.zon`:

```zig
.dependencies = .{
    .xll = .{
        .url = "https://github.com/alexjreid/zigxll/archive/refs/tags/v0.3.1.tar.gz",
        .hash = "...",
    },
},
```

Create your `build.zig`:

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn build(b: *std.Build) void {
    const target = b.resolveTargetQuery(.{
        .cpu_arch = .x86_64,
        .os_tag = .windows,
        .abi = .msvc,
    });
    const optimize = b.standardOptimizeOption(.{ .preferred_optimize_mode = .ReleaseSmall });

    const user_module = b.createModule(.{
        .root_source_file = b.path("src/main.zig"),
        .target = target,
        .optimize = optimize,
    });

    const xll_build = @import("xll");
    const xll = xll_build.buildXll(b, .{
        .name = "my_functions",
        .user_module = user_module,
        .target = target,
        .optimize = optimize,
    });

    const install_xll = b.addInstallFile(xll.getEmittedBin(), "lib/my_functions.xll");
    b.getInstallStep().dependOn(&install_xll.step);
}
```

Define your functions:

```zig
// src/my_functions.zig
const xll = @import("xll");
const ExcelFunction = xll.ExcelFunction;
const ParamMeta = xll.ParamMeta;

pub const add = ExcelFunction(.{
    .name = "add",
    .description = "Add two numbers",
    .category = "My Functions",
    .params = &[_]ParamMeta{
        .{ .name = "a", .description = "First number" },
        .{ .name = "b", .description = "Second number" },
    },
    .func = addImpl,
});

fn addImpl(a: f64, b: f64) !f64 {
    return a + b;
}
```

Wire them up in `src/main.zig`:

```zig
pub const function_modules = .{
    @import("my_functions.zig"),
};
```

Build:

```bash
zig build
```

Output lands in `zig-out/lib/my_functions.xll`. Double-click to load in Excel.

## Cross-compilation

Tests run natively without any Windows SDK:

```bash
zig build test
```

To cross-compile the XLL, install [xwin](https://jake-shadle.github.io/xwin/) for Windows SDK/CRT libraries:

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install xwin
xwin --accept-license splat --output ~/.xwin
```

**Linux:**
```bash
cargo install xwin
xwin --accept-license splat --output ~/.xwin
```

If you don't have Cargo, [install Rust](https://rustup.rs/) or grab a prebuilt binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin/releases).

Once set up, `zig build` auto-detects `~/.xwin` and cross-compiles.

## Dependencies

Uses the **Microsoft Excel 2013 XLL SDK** headers and libraries, included in `excel/`.

- **Download**: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=35567
- **Files**: `xlcall.h`, `FRAMEWRK.H`, `xlcall32.lib`, `frmwrk32.lib`

By using this software you agree to the EULA specified by Microsoft in the above download.

## Alternatives

Using Zig for XLL development is a niche within a niche. Here are some alternatives to benchmark ZigXLL against to see which best fits your needs:

- **[xladd](https://github.com/MarcusRainbow/xladd)** (Rust) - Rust wrapper around the Excel C API. Proc macros generate registration boilerplate. Similar philosophy to ZigXLL but with Rust's ecosystem and crate support. See also [xladd-derive](https://github.com/ronniec95/xladd-derive).
- **[Excel-DNA](https://excel-dna.net/)** (.NET) - The most mature option. Write UDFs in C#, VB.NET, or F#, pack everything into a single .xll. Huge community, great docs, production-proven. If you're already in the .NET ecosystem, start here.
- **[PyXLL](https://www.pyxll.com/)** (Python) - Commercial. Runs Python inside Excel with full access to NumPy, Pandas, etc. Decorate functions to expose them as UDFs. Great if your logic is already in Python. Windows only.
- **[xlwings](https://www.xlwings.org/)** (Python) - Open-source core (BSD), commercial PRO and Server tiers. Call Python from Excel and vice versa. UDFs on Windows, automation on both Windows and Mac. Also supports Google Sheets and Excel on the web.

Honourable mention: **[xllify](https://xllify.com)** is not quite the same thing - it's a platform I built on ZigXLL that lets you create Excel function add-ins for Windows, Mac, and the web without writing Zig (or any code). Describe your functions in plain English or paste existing VBA, and it generates the add-in for you.

## Projects using ZigXLL

- [zigxll-nats](https://github.com/AlexJReid/zigxll-nats) - Stream NATS messages into Excel as live data

## Commercial

ZigXLL is the MIT-licensed core behind [xllify.com](https://xllify.com), a platform for building custom Excel function add-ins for Windows, Mac, and the web.

I can also build an Excel add-in for you. Drop me an [email](mailto:alex@lexvica.com).
