# ztls

A TLS library for Zig, built on [AWS-LC](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc)'s
libcrypto. It runs over any `std.Io.Reader` and `std.Io.Writer` and hands
back a cleartext reader and writer of the same kind, on both the client and
the server side.

It was written for servers and clients on [zio](https://github.com/lalinsky/zio),
such as [Dusty](https://github.com/lalinsky/dusty), where fibers move between
threads and a connection is read by one task and written by another. AWS-LC
does the cryptography and the X.509 work, and the protocol itself is written
in Zig.

Requires Zig 0.16 or 0.17. AWS-LC is built by the Zig build system.

## Features

- TLS 1.3 client and server per [RFC 9846](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9846).
- A TLS 1.2 client, for servers that have nothing newer: ECDHE with
  AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 and the extended master secret, and no
  renegotiation. Older versions are refused. The `tls12` build option,
  set to false, leaves it out.
- AES-128-GCM, AES-256-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305.
- X25519MLKEM768, X25519, P-256 and P-384 key exchange, with
  HelloRetryRequest on both sides.
- ECDSA (P-256, P-384, P-521), RSA-PSS and Ed25519 signatures.
- Server name indication, with the server's certificate picked by name.
- ALPN.
- Client certificates, requested or required.
- Certificate verification by AWS-LC's X.509 code, against a trust store
  built from PEM or DER, from files, or from the system's roots.
- KeyUpdate in both directions and close_notify.

## Using it

```sh
zig fetch --save "git+https://github.com/lalinsky/ztls"
```

```zig
const ztls = b.dependency("ztls", .{ .target = target, .optimize = optimize });
exe.root_module.addImport("ztls", ztls.module("ztls"));
```

A server:

```zig
var pair = try ztls.CertKeyPair.fromFilePath(gpa, io, .cwd(), "chain.pem", "key.pem");
defer pair.deinit(gpa);

// The transport's reader and writer, with buffers for whole records.
var input_buffer: [ztls.input_buffer_len]u8 = undefined;
var output_buffer: [ztls.output_buffer_len]u8 = undefined;
var input = stream.reader(io, &input_buffer);
var output = stream.writer(io, &output_buffer);

var conn = try ztls.server(&input.interface, &output.interface, .{
    .gpa = gpa,
    .auth = &pair,
    .alpn_protocols = &.{ "h2", "http/1.1" },
    .now = std.Io.Clock.real.now(io),
});
defer conn.deinit(); // after both tasks are done

var read_buffer: [16 * 1024]u8 = undefined;
var reader = conn.reader(&read_buffer);
var writer = conn.writerInPlace();      // encrypts inside the transport buffer

while (try reader.interface.takeDelimiter('\n')) |line| {
    try writer.interface.print("echo: {s}\n", .{line});
    try writer.interface.flush();
}
try writer.close(); // close_notify
```

A client:

```zig
var trust = try ztls.TrustStore.init();
defer trust.deinit();
try trust.addSystemBundle(gpa, io); // or addPem(gpa, ca_pem)

var conn = try ztls.client(&input.interface, &output.interface, .{
    .gpa = gpa,
    .host = "example.com", // SNI and the name the certificate must carry
    .root_ca = &trust,
    .now = std.Io.Clock.real.now(io),
});
```

`conn.alpn_protocol` is the protocol ALPN agreed on.

### Reading and writing

After the handshake the two directions are independent: one task may read
while another writes, with no lock between them. The read side never writes
to the transport. An alert for a failure found while reading, or a KeyUpdate
the peer asked for, goes out with the next written record.

The transport buffers must hold a whole record: `input_buffer_len` for the
reader and `output_buffer_len` for the writer. The `Connection` must not
move once readers or writers exist.

The buffer given to `reader` is an ordinary `std.Io.Reader` buffer owned by
the application, sized to what it needs: its size sets how far ahead the
application can peek, for example to see a whole HTTP header. A record
that fits in it is decrypted straight into it; a larger one is decrypted
in the transport buffer and copied out in pieces as it is read.

The buffer given to `writer` is an ordinary `std.Io.Writer` buffer, again
owned by the application, which may swap it between writes. Writes that
fit are copied into it, and from there into the record where it is sealed;
larger ones go straight into the record. A record carries at most 16 KiB,
so a larger buffer gains nothing.

`writerInPlace` saves that copy: it has no buffer of its own, and its buffer
is the plaintext of the next record, inside the transport buffer. That puts
rules on the application. The writer's buffer moves with every record and
must not be replaced. `conn.close()` writes to the transport buffer too, so
close the connection with `writer.close()`, which flushes the writer first. And the transport writer
must leave its unused capacity alone while it drains, as std's and zio's
socket writers do.

`output_buffer_len` is all the transport needs either way. A larger
transport buffer only lets several sealed records go out in one transport
write.

The handshake keeps about 16 KiB on the stack of the task that runs it, plus
AWS-LC's ML-KEM working memory, so give that task at least 64 KiB of stack.
`gpa` in the options is the handshake's working memory, for example for the
peer's messages while they are reassembled, up to `max_handshake_message_len`.
Nothing allocated through it is kept after the handshake. The exception is `keep_peer_certificates`: the peer's chain is then
copied into `conn.peer_certificates`, and `gpa` must stay valid until
`conn.deinit()`.

### Errors

`std.Io.Reader` and `std.Io.Writer` only report `ReadFailed` and
`WriteFailed`. The `err` field of the ztls reader or writer has the cause:
an alert the peer sent (`TlsAlert...`), a record layer error
(`TlsBadRecordMac`, `TlsConnectionTruncated`, ...), a rejected peer
certificate under std's names (`CertificateIssuerNotFound`,
`CertificateExpired`, ...), or `ReadFailed` or `WriteFailed` when the
transport itself failed. A transport `ReadFailed`, such as a cancelled read,
does not end the connection and the read may be retried. Nor does a
transport `WriteFailed`: what was already encrypted stays in the transport
writer's buffer and goes out with the next flush. A task whose write was
cancelled can still close cleanly by calling `close`, from a `defer` under
cancel protection. What the writer held and had not yet encrypted is lost
unless it is flushed first, under the same protection.

A transport that ends between records without close_notify is a clean end
of stream; the `strict_close_notify` option makes it an error.

### Certificates and trust

`CertKeyPair` takes a PEM chain, leaf first, and a PEM private key, from
files or from memory. `TrustStore` takes certificates from PEM or DER, from
files or directories, or from the system's root store; every certificate in
it is a trust anchor. `now` is the time certificates are checked against.
A server may hold several certificates, chosen by the
client's server name and signature algorithms, or by a `select_certificate`
callback.

## Testing

Besides the unit tests, ztls is tested with:

- Client-server tests over a loopback socket, and interoperability with
  OpenSSL's `s_server` and `s_client` and with Go's `crypto/tls`, both as
  client and server.
- [BoGo](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/HEAD/ssl/test/),
  BoringSSL's test runner, against both the client and the server. Tests
  for what ztls doesn't do, such as session resumption or 0-RTT, are
  turned off in `tests/bogo/config.json`, each with its reason.
- [tlsfuzzer](https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer)'s TLS 1.3 scripts
  against the server. The probes left out are listed in
  `tests/tlsfuzzer/run.sh`, again with reasons.
- [TLS-Anvil](https://github.com/tls-attacker/TLS-Anvil) against the
  server.
- A survey of real servers, `tools/survey/run.sh`, which connects the
  client to sites from the
  [Chrome UX Report](https://github.com/zakird/crux-top-lists)'s top
  million over TLS 1.3 and 1.2, side by side with OpenSSL. It has been run
  on the top 10,000 and on 5,000 drawn at random from the whole list.
  About 10% of the servers that answer speak only TLS 1.2, which is why
  the client does too. With it, ztls reaches about 99% of the servers
  that answer; the rest need CBC suites or RSA key exchange, which ztls
  leaves out.

## Development

```sh
zig build test                                      # 0.17, or ~/.zvm/0.16.0/zig
zig build test -fwine -Dtarget=x86_64-windows-gnu   # networking tests skip under wine
zig build test -fqemu -Dtarget=aarch64-linux-musl
```

The OpenSSL and Go tests run when OpenSSL 1.1.1 or newer and Go are on the
PATH.
`tests/bogo/run.sh` runs BoGo and needs Go; `tests/tlsfuzzer/run.sh` runs
tlsfuzzer and needs Python 3. Format with Zig 0.16's `zig fmt`: 0.17's
rewrites builtins that 0.16 does not accept.

`-Dasm=false` builds AWS-LC's portable C code instead of its assembly,
which is quicker to build the first time and on x86_64 Windows does
without NASM.

`vendor/aws-lc` builds libcrypto; `gen_sources.py` there regenerates the
file lists from upstream's CMake build after an upgrade. AWS-LC's headers
reach Zig through translate-c from `src/c.h`.

ztls is [MIT](LICENSE). The test keys and the example handshake in
`src/testdata` come from [tls.zig](https://github.com/ianic/tls.zig), also
MIT, which is why its author is named in the licence too.

AWS-LC is compiled into every binary that links ztls. Its code is
Apache-2.0 or ISC, with BoringSSL-derived parts under ISC and
OpenSSL-derived parts under Apache-2.0 and the original SSLeay notice;
[its LICENSE](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc/blob/main/LICENSE) has the
details. A shipped binary carries those notices along with ztls's.
