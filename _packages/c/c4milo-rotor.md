rotor is an event loop and I/O layer for Zig. It is for servers and network libraries that must
know, before they run, how much memory they use and how their I/O behaves. It runs on io_uring on
Linux, kqueue on macOS, and epoll on Linux where io_uring is not available.

## At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| Backends | io_uring on Linux 6.1 or later; epoll on Linux where io_uring is refused; kqueue on macOS |
| Model | Completion-based. A program submits operations in batches, and each operation ends with exactly one final event. |
| Operations | TCP, UDP with ECN, files, timers and repeating timers, deadlines, cancellation, and messages between loops |
| Memory | rotor allocates nothing. A program gives each loop its memory once, at startup, and every table has a fixed limit. |
| Threads | One loop per thread, with no locks. Loops post messages to each other, across threads or processes. |
| Safety | Assertions stay on in release builds. Misuse stops the program at a named check. |
| Dependencies | None. Zig 0.16.0 and its standard library. |
| Version | 0.5.0 |

## Why rotor

- **Fast.** rotor is completion-based: a program submits operations in batches, and one system
  call per tick returns the results of many. On Linux it uses the parts of io_uring that save the
  most work: one accept and one receive that each serve many completions, buffers the kernel picks
  for each receive, and descriptors and buffers registered once. A benchmark harness in this
  repository measures every speed claim, and [its results](#performance) include the rows where
  rotor is slower.
- **Deterministic.** What a loop does depends only on what the program submits and what the
  kernel answers. rotor's core reads no clock, random number or pointer value, and its statistics
  sample every Nth operation, never by time. Every operation ends with exactly one final event, so
  a program's control flow can be followed and replayed.
- **Pluggable I/O.** One API covers io_uring, kqueue and epoll. The process picks its backend once
  and reports which it chose. The API names no kernel type, so a program can put its own
  implementation behind it, such as a simulator for tests that must replay exactly. File
  operations that would block the loop can go to threads the program supplies.
- **Predictable memory.** rotor allocates nothing. A program gives each loop its memory once, at
  startup. Every table and queue in the loop has a fixed limit, and rotor never grows one.
- **Safe to run in production.** Assertions stay on in release builds. Misuse, such as calling a
  loop from a thread that does not own it, stops the program at a named check instead of
  corrupting memory.
- **Scales by sharing nothing.** Each loop belongs to one thread and takes no locks. Loops pass
  each other messages, and a thread that owns no loop can post to one.

## Status

rotor is at version 0.5.0. Everything planned for version one is built: TCP, UDP with ECN on
both kernels and segmentation offload on Linux, files, timers, deadlines and cancellation, and
messages between loops, in one process or several. One conformance suite, written against the
public API, passes on all three backends, and CI runs it on every push.

| system | backend | requires | tested on |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linux | io_uring | Linux 6.1 or later, with the io_uring features [listed in the guide](docs/using.md#what-the-kernel-must-have) | Linux 6.17 on x86-64 (GitHub runners), Linux 7.0 on aarch64 (a virtual machine on Apple silicon) |
| Linux, where io_uring is refused or lacks a feature rotor needs | epoll | Linux 6.1 or later | both of the above, under Docker's default seccomp profile |
| macOS | kqueue | no minimum version is set | macOS 26.6 on Apple silicon |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In a container, Linux runs epoll unless io_uring is allowed.** Docker's default seccomp
> profile refuses io_uring. Run with `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined`, or a profile that allows
> the io_uring system calls, to get io_uring. `rotor.backend()` says which backend a process runs;
> a program that needs io_uring checks it at startup.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **On macOS and on epoll, file operations need a policy.** Those kernels cannot complete a file
> operation, so by default a loop refuses one with `unsupported`. Set `file_policy` at init:
> `.blocking` runs the call on the loop's thread, and `.offload` hands it to threads the program
> supplies. [The guide](docs/using.md#files) explains both.

## Quick start

Add rotor to a project:

```bash
zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/c4milo/rotor#v0.5.0
```

In `build.zig`:

```zig
const rotor = b.dependency("rotor", .{ .target = target, .release = optimize != .Debug });
exe.root_module.addImport("rotor", rotor.module("rotor"));
```

rotor's build takes `release` instead of `optimize`. It builds Debug or ReleaseSafe only, because
it has no mode that removes its assertions.

The `main` of a TCP echo server. The loop's memory is declared once, one multishot accept delivers
every connection, and each tick hands over the events that finished:

```zig
const options: rotor.Loop.Options = .{ .operations = connections_max + 1 };
var memory: [rotor.Loop.memory_bytes(options)]u8 align(rotor.memory_alignment) = undefined;

pub fn main(init: std.process.Init) !void {
    const port = try port_of(init);
    var loop: rotor.Loop = undefined;
    try loop.init(&memory, options);

    const address = rotor.Address.ipv4(.{ 127, 0, 0, 1 }, port);
    const listener = try rotor.sync.listen(&address, .{ .backlog = 128, .reuse_port = false });
    try submit(&loop, rotor.Operation.accept(tag(.accept, listener), listener, true));

    var events: [64]rotor.Event = undefined;
    while (true) {
        const count = try loop.tick(&events, rotor.constants.ns_per_s);
        for (events[0..count]) |event| try handle(&loop, event);
    }
}
```

The whole server, with its receive, send and close, is [`examples/echo.zig`](examples/echo.zig).
Run it, then connect with `nc 127.0.0.1 9000`: each line typed comes back. It takes another port as
its one argument.

```bash
zig build examples && ./zig-out/bin/echo
```

`zig build test` runs the example against a client that checks it, and the Linux gate does the same
on io_uring and on epoll: a line, 32 clients at once, 4 MiB messages, clients that read late or hang
up, and a client that closes its side. A test also checks that every line of the code above is a
line of the example, in the same order, so this page cannot drift from a program that works.

[The guide](docs/using.md) covers the rest of the API: every operation and what it promises,
deadlines and cancellation, the three ways to hand the loop buffers, datagrams, files, and loops on
several threads and in several processes.

## Performance

These are summaries of runs of the harness in this repository, with each server running one event
loop on one thread. Each cell is rotor's throughput divided by the other library's: above 1.00,
rotor is faster. A cell is `undecided` when either side's runs disagreed by 10 percent or more, or
when another step of the same run measured the two differently. The Linux columns are GitHub-hosted
runners that were given different processors, and the ratios move with the processor.

TCP echo:

| connections | payload | against | macOS, kqueue, Apple M1 Pro | Linux, io_uring, AMD EPYC 9V74 | Linux, io_uring, Intel Xeon 6973P-C | Linux, io_uring, AMD EPYC 7763 |
|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 16 | 4 KiB | libuv | 1.01 | 1.04 | 1.20 | 1.15 |
| 16 | 4 KiB | libxev | 1.24 | 1.12 | 1.33 | undecided |
| 16 | 64 KiB | libuv | 0.97 | 1.01 | 1.05 | undecided |
| 16 | 64 KiB | libxev | 0.98 | 0.92 | 1.12 | undecided |
| 64 | 4 KiB | libuv | 1.02 | 1.05 | 1.20 | 1.17 |
| 64 | 4 KiB | libxev | undecided | 1.04 | 1.27 | 1.08 |
| 64 | 64 KiB | libuv | 0.99 | 1.02 | 0.95 | 1.04 |
| 64 | 64 KiB | libxev | 1.05 | 0.91 | 0.99 | undecided |

Other workloads:

| workload | against | macOS, kqueue, Apple M1 Pro | Linux, io_uring, AMD EPYC 7763 |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| timer churn, 256 timers, fires per second | libuv | 1.22 | 1.12 |
| timer churn, 256 timers, fires per second | libxev | 1.16 | 1.04 |
| timer churn, 4,096 timers, fires per second | libuv | 2.02 | 1.96 |
| timer churn, 4,096 timers, fires per second | libxev | 1.26 | 3.58 |
| one message between loops on two cores, messages per second | libuv | 0.84, undecided | 1.12 |
| one message between loops on two cores, messages per second | libxev | 1.02, undecided | 1.11 |
| random 4 KiB file reads on a thread pool, 32 in flight | libuv | 1.00 | not measured |
| accept storm | libuv | undecided | undecided |
| accept storm | libxev | undecided | undecided |

rotor's timers keep their full rate on both machines. At 4,096 timers, libxev's fires are closer to
their deadlines than rotor's on macOS, and further from them on the EPYC 7763. On the cross-core
message on macOS, rotor was slower than libuv in every round of the latest run, by about 10 percent,
and faster than libxev in every round. On the EPYC 7763 the three have about the same median latency.
[`docs/benchmarks.md`](docs/benchmarks.md) has the full tables, with latency, memory, the machines,
and the commands to take every number again.

## Limits

- **Not in version one:** TLS, DNS, Unix sockets, process spawning, Windows, and a `std.Io`
  adapter. [Design record 2](docs/decisions/0002-scope.md) says why, and what would bring each in.
- **No C ABI.** rotor is a Zig library. [Design record 16](docs/decisions/0016-c-abi-for-c-consumers.md)
  says why it has no C interface.
- **One message between loops is slower on macOS than libuv's.** The gap is in the table above,
  and it is being worked on.
- **The Linux machine rotor is meant to run on in production has not been chosen**, so no number
  is taken on it yet. The Linux columns above come from GitHub-hosted runners.
- **Every limit is fixed at compile time or at init.** [The guide](docs/using.md#limits) lists
  them. A loop that is full refuses an operation with an error; it never grows.
