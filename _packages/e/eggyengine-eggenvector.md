# eggenvector

eggenvector (like eigenvector haha) is a math library backed by the zig SIMD `@Vector` types, and does not contain any external dependencies. 

The library specifically targets vulkan-based mathematics (as is used for the eggy engine), however many functions are available that allow for other renderers and physics engines contexts to be available (such as OpenGL). 

- Vector2|3|4|any
- Mat|2x2|3x3|4x4|any_rowXany_col
- Quaternion, UnitQuaternion
- UnitComplex (2D rotation from an euler angle)
- Unit(T) — algebraic entities with a norm equal to one, e.g. `Unit(Vec3)`
- Isometry2|3 (translation ⨯ rotation)
- Similarity2|3 (translation ⨯ rotation ⨯ uniform scale)
- Affine2|3, Projective2|3, Transform2|3 (homogeneous-matrix transformations)
- Perspective3, Orthographic3 (3D projections for computer graphics)
- Transform
- Angle

## add to project
requires zig `0.16.0` (have not tested for other zig versions, however likely works fine. please open a PR to reduce down the minimum version). 

to use this with the zig build system, import as so:
```bash
zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/eggyengine/eggenvector
```

and then in `build.zig`:
```zig
const emath = b.dependency("eggenvector", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
});

exe.root_module.addImport("eggenvector", emath.module("eggenvector"));
```

and lastly in your library/executable:
```zig
const emath = @import("eggenvector");
```
