A **lightning-fast**, single-binary reverse proxy built in Zig for DevOps and self-hosters who are tired of bloated NGINX configs.

## 🚀 Why Relay?
Tired of 50-line `nginx.conf` files just to forward a port? We are too. 

**Relay** is designed for the modern self-hoster and DevOps engineer who wants extreme performance with zero friction. It is a single compiled binary with no dependencies. Drop it in, route your traffic, and go home early.

### 🤯 The 1-Line Experience
Forward external traffic on port `80` to your local app on port `3000`:

```bash
relay --listen 80 --to localhost:3000
```
*That’s it. No config files. No reloading systemd. No screaming at the screen.*

---

## ⚡ Performance
Because Relay is built in **Zig**, it features:
- **Zero hidden control flow:** Memory management is completely transparent.
- **Microscopic footprint:** Uses virtually zero RAM compared to Java/Go alternatives.
- **Blazing Fast:** Pushes packets at the speed of the kernel.

---

## 📦 Installation

Grab the latest binary (coming soon!) or build it yourself in seconds:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DhanushNehru/relay.git
cd relay
zig build
./zig-out/bin/relay --listen 8080 --to localhost:3000
```

Or run directly with build arguments:

```bash
zig build run -- --listen 8080 --to localhost:3000
```
