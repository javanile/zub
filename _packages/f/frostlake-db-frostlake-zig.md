# frostlake-zig

A dependency-free Zig driver for [Frostlake](https://frostlake.dev), speaking the engine's
HTTP protocol against a running `DatabaseHttpServer`. No JVM, no C library — Zig's own
standard library and nothing else.

Requires **Zig 0.16.0** or newer. The driver uses the `std.Io` interface that release
introduced, so it does not build on 0.15 or earlier.

## Engine version

Requires a Frostlake engine **0.0.7 or newer**. Ask a running server which one it is with
`SELECT CURRENT_VERSION()` — every release answers it, so the check works against any engine.

The driver versions independently of the engine: it speaks the HTTP protocol, not the jar, so
this is a floor rather than a lockstep pin. One behaviour depends on the engine version —
column nullability (`Column.nullable`) reads `.unknown` from servers that predate the field.

## Using it

Add it to your `build.zig.zon`:

```sh
zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/Frostlake-DB/frostlake-zig
```

and wire the module into your build:

```zig
const frostlake = b.dependency("frostlake", .{ .target = target, .optimize = optimize });
exe.root_module.addImport("frostlake", frostlake.module("frostlake"));
```

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const frostlake = @import("frostlake");

pub fn main(init: std.process.Init) !void {
    // The DSN's scope is applied with USE, so its database has to exist first.
    var created = try frostlake.queryOnce(
        init.gpa,
        init.io,
        "frostlake://localhost:18082",
        "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS MY_DB",
        &.{},
    );
    created.deinit();

    var conn = try frostlake.Connection.open(
        init.gpa,
        init.io,
        "frostlake://localhost:18082/MY_DB?schema=PUBLIC",
    );
    defer conn.close();

    _ = try conn.exec("CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE PEOPLE (ID INTEGER, NAME VARCHAR)", &.{});
    _ = try conn.exec(
        "INSERT INTO PEOPLE VALUES (?, ?), (?, ?)",
        &.{ .of(1), .of("Ada"), .of(2), .of("Grace") },
    );

    var rows = try conn.query("SELECT ID, NAME FROM PEOPLE ORDER BY ID", &.{});
    defer rows.deinit();

    var it = rows.first().iterator();
    while (it.next()) |row| {
        std.debug.print("{d} {s}\n", .{
            try (try row.get("ID")).asInt(),
            try (try row.get("NAME")).asText(),
        });
    }
}
```

A worked example lives in [examples/demo.zig](examples/demo.zig):

```sh
zig build example -- frostlake://localhost:18082
```

### The `Io` parameter

Zig 0.16 passes an I/O implementation explicitly rather than reaching for a global, and this
driver does the same: `Connection.open` takes the `std.Io` you hand it and every socket
operation below runs on it. In a normal program that is `init.io`; in a test it is
`std.testing.io`. Nothing in the driver creates one for you, so what "blocking" means stays
your decision rather than the library's.

### DSN

```
frostlake://host:port[/DATABASE][?param=value&…]
```

| Parameter | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema` | schema to `USE` on every new session | — |
| `role` | role to `USE` on every new session | — |
| `warehouse` | warehouse to `USE` on every new session | — |
| `database` | an alternative to naming it in the path | — |
| `timeout` | how long to spend reaching the server: `5m`, `30s`, `1500ms`, `0` to disable | `5m` |
| `tz` | fixed UTC offset the engine's zoneless timestamps belong to: `UTC`, `+02:00`, `-0500` | `UTC` |
| `tls` | `true` to speak HTTPS — an `https://` DSN does the same | `false` |

The role, warehouse, database and schema are applied as `USE` statements on the session before
its first statement. An unknown parameter is an error rather than a silent no-op, and so is a
username or password — the engine's HTTP API has no authentication to hand them to.

## Semantics

- **Parameters** are inlined client-side (the protocol has no server-side binding), with the
  same rules as Frostlake's JDBC driver: strings escape backslashes and quotes, `Value.bytes`
  binds as a hex `BINARY` literal, a `Timestamp` as a `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` or `TIMESTAMP_TZ` literal
  depending on whether it carries an offset. A `?` inside a string literal, quoted identifier,
  `$$…$$` body or comment is never a placeholder. Whenever arguments are supplied the count
  has to match the placeholder count exactly; with none at all the `?` marks pass through to
  the server, which is where a Snowflake Scripting cursor binds them (`OPEN c USING (...)`).
  A negative number is rendered in parentheses, so `3-?` bound `-5` stays an expression
  rather than opening a `--` comment.
- **Values** are a tagged union. `Value.of(x)` infers the variant from `x`'s Zig type; the
  cases a type cannot distinguish are named instead — `Value.bytes` for `BINARY` (because
  `[]const u8` is Zig's string type too), `Value.decimalText` for digits to keep exact,
  `Value.jsonText` for a VARIANT, `Value.rawSql` to inline SQL verbatim. A union literal such
  as `.{ .integer = 1 }` always works too.
- **Named parameters**: a statement may use positional `?` or named `:name` placeholders — one
  style per statement, mixing them is an error. Named arguments bind by name, so their order
  does not matter, and one that names no placeholder is an error rather than a quiet no-op. A
  `::` cast, a `:=` assignment and a `:1` positional reference are never parameters — and
  neither is Snowflake's VARIANT path access: a colon glued to the end of an expression
  (`v:field`, `PARSE_JSON('…'):k`, `"V":k`) reads a field, so a bind marker must follow an
  operator, comma or keyword boundary (`WHERE x = :a`). Passed to `query` with **no arguments
  at all**, colon references pass through to the server untouched — that is what Snowflake
  Scripting variables look like (`EXECUTE IMMEDIATE :v`, `IFF(:flag, …)`).
- **Types**: `DATE`, `TIME` and every `TIMESTAMP` variant read as `Date`/`Time`/`Timestamp`;
  `BINARY` as bytes; integral `NUMBER` columns as `i64`; `BOOLEAN` as `bool`;
  VARIANT/OBJECT/ARRAY as their JSON text.
- **Exact numbers stay exact.** A `NUMBER` with a scale — `NUMBER(12,2)`, what money lives in —
  reads back as its digits, not as an `f64`. Reading `135500.50` into a float gives `135500.5`,
  and `0.1` into a float gives something that is not `0.1`; both are the wrong value, not a
  formatting detail. `FLOAT`/`DOUBLE`/`REAL` are binary floats and read as `f64`, because that
  is what those columns actually hold. An integer too wide for `i64` — `NUMBER(38,0)` holds
  them — arrives as its exact digits too. Every one of these still answers `asFloat()` for a
  caller who wants a number.
- **Column metadata** reports the engine's type name, nullability, and precision and scale for
  numeric columns. Nullability is three-valued: a server predating the field reads `.unknown`,
  which is worth telling apart from "not nullable".
- **Several statements in one request**: `A; B` answers with one result set each.
  `Response.set(i)` walks them, and `rowsAffected` adds up the DML counts.
- **Errors** are a Zig error set plus a diagnostic record. `Error.EngineRefused` means the
  engine reported the statement as failed; `Error.TransportFailed` means the request never
  became an answer; `Error.NotFrostlake` means something answered but not an engine. The detail
  lives on the connection:

  ```zig
  conn.query("SELECT * FROM missing", &.{}) catch |err| {
      if (err == frostlake.Error.EngineRefused) {
          std.log.err("engine refused: {s}", .{conn.lastError()});
      }
  };
  ```

  **`conn.lastStatement()` holds the rendered SQL.** Because binding is client-side, that means
  every parameter inlined — a bound password or card number appears in it verbatim.
  `lastError()` carries none of it, so log that freely and treat `lastStatement()` as sensitive.
- **Transactions**: `begin`/`commit`/`rollback` ride the session's autocommit flag plus
  `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` statements, matching the JDBC transport. The engine offers read
  committed and nothing else, so there is no isolation level to choose. A `commit` that fails
  attempts a rollback and then retires the connection rather than leaving one whose state the
  driver had to guess at.
- **A broken connection is retired, never retried.** When the transport fails — the host
  refuses, the socket dies, the answer is not a Frostlake response — the connection is marked
  unusable and every later call on it fails fast. The statement is *not* re-run: after a
  transport failure its fate is unknown, and re-running it would duplicate an `INSERT`.
- **Sessions**: one HTTP session per `Connection`. A statement that moves the session's scope —
  `USE`, the `SET` family, `ALTER SESSION`, and `CREATE`/`DROP` of a `DATABASE` or `SCHEMA` —
  is therefore scoped to that one connection. Every statement in a request is examined, so a
  `USE` riding behind a leading `SELECT` counts too. `conn.reset()` puts the session back on
  the DSN's scope for a connection being reused across unrelated work; with no scope in the DSN
  there is nothing to restore, so it retires the connection instead.

  Two routes still move the scope without the driver seeing it — `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` of a
  `USE`, and a procedure that switches scope when `CALL`ed — so prefer naming the scope in the
  DSN when it matters.

## Known limitations

- **Server sessions are not released on close.** The HTTP API has no endpoint for ending a
  session, so a closed connection's session lingers until the engine's own 30-minute idle sweep
  reclaims it. Connection churn therefore accrues server-side sessions — enough of them will
  take the server down, so prefer holding a connection over opening one per query.
- **A session idle past that sweep silently resumes at the server's default scope**, because
  the engine re-creates an expired session under the same id and nothing in the answer says so.
  The driver covers this by re-establishing the DSN's scope on a connection idle for more than
  five minutes, but anything else the session held — session variables, an `ALTER SESSION`
  setting — is gone.
- **`timeout` is not enforced on Zig 0.16.0.** The driver hands the DSN's `timeout` to
  `std.http.Client.connectTcpOptions`, whose `timeout` field the 0.16.0 standard library
  declares but never reads (and whose Windows connect path has no timed variant yet), so an
  unreachable host waits for the operating system's own connect timeout and a statement that
  runs forever on the server is still waited for. This is a limit of the standard library
  rather than a choice, and it is spelled out here rather than left for you to discover.
- **`tz` is a fixed offset, not a zone.** Zig ships no IANA zone database, so `Europe/Warsaw`
  could only be honoured by guessing one of its two offsets. A zone name is refused with a
  message saying so rather than silently resolved to one that is wrong for half the year.
- **Timestamps lose sub-millisecond precision in transit.** The engine holds full nanoseconds,
  but the HTTP layer serialises milliseconds, so a `Timestamp` round trip is millisecond-precise
  however fine the value bound.
- **The connection is not threadsafe.** One `Connection` is one session; share one across
  threads and their statements interleave on it. Give each thread its own.
- **An array holding a VARIANT `undefined` cannot be read.** Engine 0.0.7 renders it as the
  bare token `undefined`, which is not JSON, so the answer to `FILTER(ARRAY_CONSTRUCT(1, NULL,
  2), …)` and its kind is a body no strict parser accepts. The driver reports that specifically
  rather than as a generic protocol mismatch, but it cannot read the value; the fix belongs on
  the server.
- **An empty statement is refused by the endpoint, not the parser.** `POST /api/execute` rejects
  a blank `sql` itself with `SQL is required`, so the engine's own `Empty SQL statement.`
  message never reaches a client over HTTP.

## Tests

The unit tests need nothing installed — no engine, no JVM, no network:

```sh
zig build test
```

They cover the parts the driver decides on its own: DSN parsing, which characters are bind
markers, what each value renders as, how a cell is typed, and — over a mock transport — how a
connection keeps its session's scope, retires itself, and runs a transaction.

The integration tests talk to a running engine and skip themselves when `FROSTLAKE_URL` names
none, so they are never falsely green:

```sh
FROSTLAKE_URL=frostlake://localhost:18082 zig build test-integration
```

`zig build test-all` runs both.

Expect `CONNECTION_REFUSED` traces on stderr during the integration run. They come from
`std.Io`'s happy-eyeballs connect: `localhost` resolves to both `::1` and `127.0.0.1`, the
engine binds one of them, and the standard library prints the failed half before succeeding on
the other. The tests pass regardless.
